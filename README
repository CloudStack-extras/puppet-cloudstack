Test Plan: 
So this should start from easiest submodules to most complex. 
So I am testing in this order: 

NFS server:
(Can I successfully add primary and secondary storage to an existing cloudstack instance)

Management Server: 
Do the packages get installed properly (repos setup?)
Once installed does database get provisioned
Once database provisioned does UI come up? 

Agent: 
Soooo much to test here.....basically does it work.
